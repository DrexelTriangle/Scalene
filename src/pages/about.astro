        <div>
            The Triangle is Drexel University's editorially and financially independent student newspaper. 
            The Triangle publishes bi-weekly throughout the year. For 100 years, The Triangle has been Drexel students' 
            source for campus news and voice for opinions.

        <div>
            The Triangle first appeared on campus in February 1926 under the direction of inaugural Editor-in-Chief Thomas T. Mather ('27) 
            and with blessing and partial funding from then-President Kenneth G. Matheson and Drexel Institute's Board of Trustees. Since then, 
            The Triangle has been staffed by prominent members of the Drexel community, like former President and Myers Hall namesake Harold 
            Myers (Business Manager, '38), as well as celebrities including Chuck Barris (Columnist, '53), John Gruber (Editor-in-Chief, '90) 
            and Albert Boscov (Sports Writer, '48).
            <br/><br/>
            The Triangle has been nationally recognized with several Mark of Excellence awards from the Society of Professional Journalists in 
            Editorial Writing, General Column Writing, and Sports Column Writing. The Triangle is also an accredited member of the Associated 
            Collegiate Press and has won two National Pacemaker Awards.
            <br/><br/>
            With Drexel being the first university to require incoming students to have personal computers, The Triangle's first online edition 
            appeared in the mid-1990s and was instantly available to all students. Originally hosted on a staff member's computer, thetriangle.org 
            became a portal for Drexel students to not only read the newspaper in a convenient online format, but to connect with one another in 
            the age before social media.
            <br/><br/>
            Today's website offers all the content you'd find in our print edition, but also includes archives and other content that doesn't fit 
            in the traditional print medium.
            <br/><br/>
            Being independent from the University, all decisions regarding content and the paper's growth are made by the Editor-in-Chief and the 
            Editorial Board. The Triangle is currently home to over 125 student staff members who work year-round to produce professional-quality 
            content with the aim of keeping Drexel students informed on the topics of news, arts and entertainment, opinion, and sports.
